# SHeM-3D-Print-Pinhole-Plate

Data and scripts to support the paper titled "Complex optical elements for scanning helium microscopy through 3D printing". PumpingCurveProcessing.m generates the pumpdown curve and pinhole_measurements_v2.m will generate the z scans.

Models for the new pinhole plate and shielding to emulate the original design are also provided
